# Land View UI Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document outlines a phased, test-driven approach for implementing the Land View UI. Each phase is designed to be independently testable, with clear validation steps to ensure no regressions occur between stages. The approach is modular, data-driven, and strictly aligned to project rules and Godot best practices.

---

## Phase 1: UI Scaffolding & Layout
### Goals
- Establish the basic scene structure and layout for the Land View UI.
- Ensure all panels (Tile Interaction, World View, Tile Information) are present and correctly arranged.

### Tasks
- Create `LandViewPanel` scene with an `HSplitContainer`.
- Add `TileInteractionPanel`, `WorldViewPanel`, and `TileInfoPanel` as children.
- Set fixed and expanding sizes as per design.
- Add placeholder content (e.g., "Build" button, empty grid, info label).

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Visually confirm layout in the Godot editor and running game.
- Automated: UI test to check all panels are present and correctly sized.
- Regression: Snapshot test of layout to detect accidental changes.

---

## Phase 2: World View Grid & Scrolling
### Goals
- Implement the 5x5 tile grid in the World View.
- Add scrolling controls to adjust the visible tile viewport.

### Tasks
- Use a `GridContainer` to display 25 tile buttons.
- Implement arrow buttons for scrolling (up/down/left/right).
- Maintain a viewport (top-left tile index) to determine which tiles are shown.
- Ensure grid updates when scrolled.

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Scroll in all directions, confirm correct tiles are shown.
- Automated: Test grid updates for various scroll positions and edge cases.
- Regression: Test that scrolling does not break layout or selection.

---

## Phase 3: Tile Selection & Signal Wiring
### Goals
- Allow player to select a tile in the grid.
- Emit a signal when a tile is selected.
- Highlight the selected tile.

### Tasks
- Add selection logic to tile buttons.
- Emit `tile_selected(tile_id: int)` from `WorldViewPanel`.
- Update visual state to show which tile is selected.
- Connect signal to `LandViewPanel` and `TileInfoPanel`.

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Select tiles, confirm highlight and info update.
- Automated: Test signal emission and selection logic.
- Regression: Ensure scrolling does not reset selection unexpectedly.

---

## Phase 4: Tile Information Display
### Goals
- Show correct information for the selected tile in `TileInfoPanel`.
- Display terrain, building, and resources if surveyed; otherwise, show "Parcel not surveyed".

### Tasks
- Implement data classes for tile/world state.
- Pass mock data to panels for testing.
- Update `TileInfoPanel` to display correct info based on selection and surveyed status.

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Select surveyed and unsurveyed tiles, confirm info display.
- Automated: Test info panel updates for all tile states.
- Regression: Ensure info panel does not show stale or incorrect data.

---

## Phase 5: Integration & Data-Driven Updates
### Goals
- Integrate UI with actual game data (from autoloads or data classes).
- Ensure UI updates in response to game state changes (e.g., surveying a tile, building construction).

### Tasks
- Connect panels to data sources via dependency injection.
- Implement observer pattern or signals for data updates.
- Ensure all UI updates are data-driven.

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Trigger game events, confirm UI updates.
- Automated: Simulate data changes, test UI response.
- Regression: Ensure UI remains stable and correct as data changes.

---

## Phase 6: Final Polish & Accessibility
### Goals
- Refine UI responsiveness and accessibility.
- Prepare for future enhancements (zoom, resize grid, mini-map).

### Tasks
- Make grid and panels responsive to window size.
- Add accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, tooltips).
- Document all classes, functions, and signals.

### Testing/Validation
- Manual: Test at various resolutions and input methods.
- Automated: Accessibility and responsiveness tests.
- Regression: Ensure no loss of functionality or usability.

---

## Continuous Testing & Regression Prevention
- At each phase, introduce automated and manual tests.
- Use snapshot and state-based tests to detect regressions.
- Maintain a test suite for all UI components.
- Require all tests to pass before advancing to the next phase.

## Summary
This phased approach ensures a robust, modular, and testable Land View UI, with continuous validation and alignment to project rules. Each phase builds on the last, with clear goals, tasks, and testing strategies to prevent regressions and ensure quality.
