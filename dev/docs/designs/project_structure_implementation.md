# Project Structure Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the new project structure. Each phase is designed to maintain a working game state while progressively introducing new organisation patterns. The plan emphasises early UI access and comprehensive testing.

## Phase 0: Preparation
**Goal**: Set up the foundation for the new structure while maintaining the current game state.

### Tasks
1. Create new top-level directories
   - `features/`
   - `shared/`
   - `globals/`
   - `main/`
   - `data/`

2. Set up testing infrastructure
   - Move existing tests to appropriate locations
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Create test templates for features

3. Create initial UI framework
   - Basic menu system
   - Placeholder screens for features
   - Loading/transition screens

### Testing Focus
- Test harness setup
- Basic UI navigation
- Resource loading

## Phase 1: Global Infrastructure
**Goal**: Establish core systems and shared resources.

### Tasks
1. Move global scripts to `globals/`
   - Event buses
   - Constants
   - Library loader

2. Set up shared resources in `shared/`
   - UI components
   - Data classes
   - Utility functions
   - Move assets

3. Create basic UI components
   - Buttons
   - Labels
   - Panels
   - Common dialogs

### Testing Focus
- Event bus communication
- Resource loading/unloading
- UI component behaviour
- Cross-feature integration tests

## Phase 2: First Feature Migration
**Goal**: Move one complete feature to demonstrate the new structure.

### Tasks
1. Choose a relatively independent feature
   - Suggest starting with `world_map`
   - Include all related scripts, scenes, and data
   - Set up feature-specific tests

2. Create feature UI
   - Main feature interface
   - Feature-specific components
   - Integration with global UI

3. Document the migration process
   - Update templates
   - Note common issues
   - Create checklist

### Testing Focus
- Feature functionality
- UI integration
- Performance impact
- Resource management

## Phase 3: Domain-Based Migration
**Goal**: Group related features into domains and migrate them together.

### Tasks
1. Migrate `economic_actor` domain
   - Buildings system
   - People system
   - Jobs system
   - Domain-specific UI

2. Migrate `economy` domain
   - Market system
   - Production system
   - Economy UI components

3. Update cross-feature communication
   - Event bus connections
   - Shared state management
   - UI updates

### Testing Focus
- Domain integration
- Cross-domain communication
- UI responsiveness
- Resource usage

## Phase 4: Shared Systems Enhancement
**Goal**: Optimise shared resources and cross-feature interactions.

### Tasks
1. Refine shared components
   - Identify common patterns
   - Create new shared components
   - Optimise existing ones

2. Enhance UI framework
   - Add advanced UI features
   - Improve performance
   - Add animations/transitions

3. Implement comprehensive logging
   - Feature usage
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

### Testing Focus
- Component reusability
- UI performance
- System integration
- Error handling

## Phase 5: Final Migration and Optimization
**Goal**: Complete the migration and optimise the entire system.

### Tasks
1. Migrate remaining features
   - Laws system
   - Any remaining subsystems
   - Clean up old structure

2. Performance optimization
   - Resource loading
   - Scene management
   - Memory usage

3. Documentation update
   - Architecture guide
   - Feature documentation
   - Testing guide

### Testing Focus
- Full system integration
- Performance benchmarks
- Regression testing
- User acceptance testing

## UI Accessibility Throughout Phases

### Phase 0-1
- Basic menu system
- Feature placeholders
- Loading screens
- Settings interface

### Phase 2
- First feature fully playable
- Basic interaction model
- Feedback system

### Phase 3
- Domain-specific interfaces
- Cross-feature interaction
- Enhanced feedback

### Phase 4-5
- Full feature set
- Polished interactions
- Complete UI system

## Testing Strategy

### Continuous Testing
- Unit tests with each feature
- Integration tests in shared
- Performance benchmarks
- UI/UX testing

### Regression Prevention
- Automated test suite
- Feature comparison tests
- Performance monitoring
- UI consistency checks

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Feature-specific functionality
   - Shared components
   - UI elements

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Cross-feature communication
   - UI integration
   - Resource management

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Resource usage
   - Loading times
   - UI responsiveness

4. **User Acceptance Tests**
   - Feature completeness
   - UI usability
   - Game flow

## Success Criteria
- All features migrated
- No functionality loss
- Improved performance
- Better developer experience
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation
- Maintainable structure

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase has a rollback point
- Feature toggles for new structure
- Parallel systems during migration
- Data backup strategy
