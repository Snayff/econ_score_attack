# Law Builder System Design

## Overview
The Law Builder System enables players to create custom laws that affect their demesne's economic and social fabric. This system provides a flexible, modular approach to law creation while maintaining game balance and simulation integrity.

## Core Systems

### 1. Treasury Management System

#### Principles
- All monetary effects must be predictable and trackable
- Treasury impacts should be both immediate and projected
- Laws should have built-in budget constraints
- System should prevent bankruptcy through overspending

#### Components
1. **Budget Allocation**
   - Dedicated law budgets
   - Automatic reallocation
   - Emergency fund reservation
   - Priority-based spending

2. **Spending Tracking**
   - Real-time treasury monitoring
   - Per-law spending limits
   - Automatic suspension on depletion
   - Spending history analytics

3. **Impact Forecasting**
   - Future cost projections
   - Population trend consideration
   - Seasonal variation accounting
   - Warning threshold system

### 2. Event System

#### Principles
- Hierarchical and composable events
- Flexible but deterministic conditions
- Complex trigger chains
- Immediate and delayed responses

#### Components
1. **Event Hierarchy**
   - Population events (birth, death, marriage)
   - Economic events (trade, production)
   - Social events (festivals, gatherings)
   - Resource events (shortages, surplus)

2. **Condition System**
   - Boolean combinations
   - Temporal conditions
   - State-based conditions
   - Comparative conditions

3. **Response Chains**
   - Primary/secondary effects
   - Delayed responses
   - Conditional branching
   - Effect propagation limits

### 3. Resource Distribution System

#### Principles
- Physical resource tracking
- Configurable fairness rules
- Graceful scarcity handling
- Modular distribution methods

#### Components
1. **Resource Tracking**
   - Physical location system
   - Storage capacity management
   - Maintenance cost tracking
   - Transport requirements

2. **Distribution Methods**
   - Equal distribution
   - Weighted distribution
   - Priority-based distribution
   - Market-based distribution

3. **Scarcity Management**
   - Priority queuing
   - Partial fulfillment
   - Resource substitution
   - Emergency reserves

## Law Types

### 1. Subsidy Laws
- Transaction monitoring
- Percentage/fixed calculations
- Treasury impact tracking
- Good/building specificity

### 2. Reward Laws
- Population event monitoring
- One-time payments
- Citizen tracking
- Event-based triggers

### 3. Sale Ban Laws
- Market transaction prevention
- Availability control
- Inventory management
- Trade restriction handling

### 4. Child Limit Laws
- Family unit tracking
- Birth event monitoring
- Child counting system
- Future punishment integration

### 5. Festival Laws
- Scheduled events
- Resource distribution
- Multi-good handling
- Population-wide effects

## UI/UX Considerations

### 1. Law Builder Interface
- Component-based assembly
- Real-time preview
- Cost estimation
- Validity checking

### 2. Feedback Systems
- Treasury impact preview
- Population effect estimates
- Resource requirement forecasts
- Warning indicators

### 3. Management Interface
- Active law monitoring
- Impact tracking
- Modification tools
- Deactivation controls

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Structure
- Component-based design
- JSON configuration
- Modular effects system
- Extensible framework

### 2. Validation System
- Component compatibility
- Resource availability
- Treasury impacts
- Population effects

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Event batching
- Resource update optimisation
- Treasury calculation caching
- Distribution efficiency

## Integration Points

### 1. Economic System
- Market interaction
- Resource flow
- Treasury management
- Trade impacts

### 2. Population System
- Demographic tracking
- Event monitoring
- Status effects
- Behaviour modification

### 3. Resource System
- Physical tracking
- Distribution management
- Storage handling
- Transport logistics

## Future Expandability

### 1. New Law Types
- Template system
- Component library

- Trigger system

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Complex conditions
- Multi-law interactions
- Advanced distributions
- Dynamic adjustments

### 3. System Extensions
