# Market System Implementation Guide for AI Agents

## Overview
This guide outlines the phased approach for implementing the market system. Each phase is designed to be implemented sequentially, with clear validation points and dependencies.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures
**Goal:** Establish the foundational data classes needed for market operations.

1. Create `scripts/data/data_market_transaction.gd`:
   - Follow project rules for data classes
   - Implement all properties with proper typing
   - Add comprehensive docstrings
   - Include example usage in class documentation
   - Validate inputs in _init

2. Create `scripts/data/data_trade_order.gd`:
   - Follow same pattern as DataMarketTransaction
   - Keep functionality focused on data representation
   - Include validation for negative amounts

**Validation:**
- Verify each class can be instantiated
- Confirm proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Check documentation completeness

### Phase 2: Market Class Foundation
**Goal:** Create the basic Market class structure.

1. Create `scripts/core/market.gd`:
   - Set up all required regions (CONSTANTS, SIGNALS, etc.)
   - Implement basic initialization with demesne
   - Add price management functionality
   - Include proper logging setup

2. Add core interfaces:
   - Public methods for price queries
   - Transaction history access
   - Market state queries

**Validation:**
- Verify class loads correctly
- Confirm proper demesne connection
- Test price initialization
- Check logging functionality

### Phase 3: Trade Processing Implementation
**Goal:** Implement the core trading functionality.

1. Implement market state gathering:
   - Create _gather_market_state method
   - Add supply/demand tracking
   - Implement proper error handling

2. Add trade processing:
   - Implement _process_trades method
   - Add seller/buyer randomization
   - Include transaction validation

3. Implement trade execution:
   - Create _execute_trade method
   - Add money transfer logic
   - Add goods transfer logic
   - Implement tax handling

**Validation:**
- Test complete trade cycle
- Verify randomization works
- Confirm proper resource transfers
- Check tax calculations

### Phase 4: Economic Integration
**Goal:** Integrate with economic systems.

1. Add economic tracking:
   - Implement transaction recording
   - Add market metrics tracking
   - Connect to economic validator

2. Implement signal system:
   - Add trade_completed signal
   - Add market_activity_recorded signal
   - Include proper signal documentation

**Validation:**
- Verify economic data flow
- Test signal connections
- Check metric accuracy
- Validate economic invariants

### Phase 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Goal:** Ensure system robustness.

1. Implement comprehensive error handling:
   - Add input validation
   - Handle resource insufficiency
   - Manage transaction limits
   - Add safety checks

2. Add edge case handling:
   - Handle empty market scenarios
   - Manage failed transactions
   - Handle tax law changes
   - Deal with dead/invalid actors

**Validation:**
- Test all error conditions
- Verify proper error recovery
- Check edge case handling
- Confirm system stability

### Phase 6: Optimization and Refinement
**Goal:** Optimize performance and usability.

1. Optimize performance:
   - Review data structure usage
   - Optimize loops and calculations
   - Add caching where beneficial

2. Enhance logging:
   - Add detailed debug logging
   - Implement performance logging
   - Add market state logging

3. Improve documentation:
   - Update all docstrings
   - Add more usage examples
   - Include performance notes

**Validation:**
- Run performance tests
- Review log clarity
- Verify documentation completeness

## Implementation Notes

### Code Style
- Follow GDScript best practices
- Use static typing consistently
- Follow project naming conventions
- Maintain proper region structure

### Testing Approach
- Test each component in isolation
- Verify integration points
- Test with various market sizes
- Include edge case testing

### Common Pitfalls
- Avoid direct actor state manipulation
- Don't skip validation steps
- Maintain proper error handling
- Keep functions focused and small

### Performance Considerations
- Monitor memory usage
- Watch for loop efficiency
- Consider large market impact
- Track transaction volume

## Completion Criteria
1. All phases implemented and validated
2. Documentation complete and accurate
3. Tests passing and comprehensive
4. Performance metrics satisfactory
5. Code review feedback addressed
6. Integration tests successful

## Maintenance Guidelines
1. Keep data classes isolated
2. Maintain clear interfaces
3. Update documentation promptly
4. Monitor performance metrics
5. Review error logs regularly
