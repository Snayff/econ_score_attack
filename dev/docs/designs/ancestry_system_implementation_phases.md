# Ancestry and Culture System Implementation Phases

## Phase Overview
This document outlines the implementation approach for the ancestry and culture system, designed for AI agents to understand the logical progression and dependencies.

## Phase 1: Core Data Structure Implementation

### Objective
Establish the foundational data structures and loading mechanisms.

### Steps
1. Create base data classes:
   - `DataPersonAncestry`
   - `DataPersonCulture`
   
2. Implement data loading:
   - Create `ancestries.json` structure
   - Add loading functionality to `Library` class
   - Implement validation checks

### Success Criteria
- Data classes correctly store and validate all required fields
- JSON data successfully loads and parses into data classes
- Error handling captures and reports all validation issues

## Phase 2: Component Integration

### Objective
Create and integrate the component system for individual persons.

### Steps
1. Implement base components:
   - `PersonAncestryComponent`
   - `PersonCultureComponent`

2. Add core calculations:
   - Resource consumption modifiers
   - Job preference calculations
   - Social interaction modifiers

3. Integrate with person class:
   - Add component references
   - Implement initialisation logic
   - Add accessor methods

### Success Criteria
- Components properly attach to person instances
- Calculations produce correct results
- Component state properly persists

## Phase 3: Economic Integration

### Objective
Integrate ancestry and cultural effects into the economic system.

### Steps
1. Resource Consumption:
   - Modify resource consumption calculations
   - Implement ancestry-based efficiency modifiers
   - Add cultural trade preferences

2. Job System Integration:
   - Add cultural job preferences
   - Implement traditional occupation bonuses
   - Add crafting specialties

3. Market Integration:
   - Implement cultural trade value modifiers
   - Add specialty good preferences

### Success Criteria
- Resource consumption varies by ancestry
- Job preferences affect career choices
- Market prices reflect cultural preferences

## Phase 4: Social System Integration

### Objective
Implement social interaction and cultural effects.

### Steps
1. Social Interactions:
   - Implement cross-cultural interaction modifiers
   - Add cultural practice effects
   - Create social group formation logic

2. Cultural Transmission:
   - Add cultural learning mechanics
   - Implement tradition passing
   - Create cultural adaptation rules

### Success Criteria
- Social interactions reflect cultural differences
- Cultural practices affect behaviour
- Cultural transmission occurs naturally

## Phase 5: Demographic Integration

### Objective
Implement ancestry effects on population dynamics.

### Steps
1. Reproduction System:
   - Add cross-ancestry compatibility checks
   - Implement fertility modifiers
   - Create inheritance rules

2. Life Cycle Integration:
   - Add life expectancy modifiers
   - Implement age-related effects
   - Create demographic tracking

### Success Criteria
- Cross-ancestry reproduction works correctly
- Population demographics reflect ancestry traits
- Life cycles vary appropriately by ancestry

## Phase 6: UI and Feedback

### Objective
Create user interface elements and feedback systems.

### Steps
1. Information Display:
   - Add ancestry/culture info panels
   - Create population demographics view
   - Implement cultural practice indicators

2. Feedback Systems:
   - Add visual feedback for interactions
   - Create notification system for significant events
   - Implement tooltip information

### Success Criteria
- All information is clearly displayed
- User can easily understand ancestry/cultural effects
- Feedback provides clear cause-and-effect understanding

## Phase 7: Testing and Balance

### Objective
Ensure system balance and stability.

### Steps
1. Testing:
   - Create unit tests for all calculations
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

2. Balancing:
   - Adjust modifiers for game balance
   - Fine-tune interaction effects
   - Balance demographic effects

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Profile system performance
   - Implement caching where beneficial
   - Optimize calculations

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- System performs within performance budgets
- Gameplay feels balanced and meaningful

## Implementation Notes

### Data Validation
- Each phase should include appropriate validation
- Early phases should fail fast on invalid data
- Later phases should gracefully handle edge cases

### Performance Considerations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Batch process where possible
- Monitor memory usage

### Error Handling
- Use event bus for error reporting
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Maintain detailed error logs

### Documentation
- Update documentation with each phase
- Include examples for complex features
- Document all assumptions and decisions
