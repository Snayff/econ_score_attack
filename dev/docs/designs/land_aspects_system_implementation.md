# Land Aspects System - Phased Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the phased approach to implementing the Land Aspects system,

## Phase 1: Core Data Structure and Basic Generation
**Goal**: Establish the foundational system with minimal UI

### Implementation Steps
1. Create basic data structures
   - Aspect data schema
   - Parcel aspect storage
   - Basic validation

2. Implement AspectManager
   - Basic aspect generation
   - Data validation
   - Event logging

3. Create Simple UI
   - Basic tile info panel showing aspect names
   - Debug overlay for developers

### Testing Focus
- Unit tests for data validation
- Generation with controlled RNG
- Basic UI updates

### Success Criteria
- Aspects are generated during world creation
- Basic display of aspect data
- All events properly logged

## Phase 2: Survey System Integration
**Goal**: Add surveying mechanics and improve UI

### Implementation Steps
1. Implement Survey Mechanics
   - Survey progress tracking
   - Aspect discovery system
   - Survey completion events

2. Enhance UI
   - Survey progress indicator
   - Discovered vs undiscovered states
   - Basic survey controls

3. Add Event Bus Integration
   - Survey-related signals
   - UI update events

### Testing Focus
- Survey mechanics
- UI state management
- Event propagation

### Success Criteria
- Working survey system
- Clear UI feedback
- Proper event handling

## Phase 3: Extraction Methods and Building Integration
**Goal**: Connect aspects to the building system

### Implementation Steps
1. Implement Extraction Methods
   - Building requirements
   - Finite/infinite resource handling
   - Amount tracking

2. Enhance UI
   - Show extraction methods
   - Building requirements display
   - Amount tracking for finite aspects

3. Building System Integration
   - Building placement validation
   - Resource production setup

### Testing Focus
- Building placement rules
- Resource production
- UI accuracy

### Success Criteria
- Buildings properly check for required aspects
- Resource production working
- Clear UI feedback for requirements

## Phase 4: Enhanced UI and Quality of Life
**Goal**: Polish the system and improve user experience

### Implementation Steps
1. Advanced UI Features
   - Detailed aspect information panel, including extraction details
   - Tooltips and help text
   - Visual indicators for finite resources

2. Quality of Life Improvements
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Bulk survey options
   - Better error messages

3. Performance Optimizations
   - UI update batching
   - Data structure optimization
   - Memory usage improvements

### Testing Focus
- UI responsiveness
- Memory usage
- User experience

### Success Criteria
- Smooth, intuitive interface
- Optimized performance
- Positive user feedback

## Testing Strategy Across Phases

### Continuous Testing
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for system interaction
- UI/UX testing for each phase
- Performance benchmarking

### Regression Testing
- Automated test suite for core functionality
- UI component tests
- Event system verification
- Data integrity checks

### Documentation
- Update design docs with each phase
- Maintain test documentation
- Track known issues and limitations

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow project coding standards
- Maintain type safety
- Document all public interfaces
- Use clear naming conventions

### Version Control
- Feature branches for each phase
- Clear commit messages
- Regular integration with main branch
- Tag releases for each phase

### Review Points
- Code review at phase completion
- Performance review
- UI/UX review
- Documentation review

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage > 90%
- No critical bugs
- Performance within targets
- Clean static analysis

### User Experience Metrics
- UI response time < 16ms
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Intuitive controls
- Helpful error messages

## Rollback Plan
- Version control tags for each phase
- Data migration scripts
- Feature flags for new functionality
- Backup of critical data structures

This phased approach ensures we can:
- Get early feedback through the UI
- Maintain quality through testing
- Avoid regressions
- Deliver incremental value
- Respond to feedback at each phase

Each phase builds on the previous one while maintaining a working system throughout the development process.
