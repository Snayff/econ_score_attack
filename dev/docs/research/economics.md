# Considerations for an Economy
## Scarcity and Choice
Scarcity means resources (like time, money, labor, and raw materials) are limited.

Because we can’t have everything, people and societies must make choices about how to use resources.

This leads to the concept of opportunity cost—the value of what you give up when you choose one thing over another.

## Supply and Demand
Prices are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers.

Demand: How much people want something at a given price.

Supply: How much producers are willing to offer at that price.

Where they meet is the market equilibrium, balancing quantity supplied and demanded.

## Incentives Matter
People and businesses respond to rewards and penalties.

Prices, profits, and taxes all influence behavior.

Good economic policy often works by shaping incentives, not forcing outcomes.

## Specialization and Trade
Individuals, regions, and countries focus on what they do best (comparative advantage), and trade for the rest.

This leads to greater efficiency, more output, and often lower prices.

## Markets Usually Work Well—But Not Always
Markets are powerful for organizing economic activity, but:
    They can fail (e.g., pollution, monopolies, or public goods)
    Government sometimes needs to step in to correct those failures

## Productivity Drives Standard of Living
The key to long-term economic growth is increasing productivity—producing more output per unit of input (especially per worker).

Education, technology, infrastructure, and innovation are major contributors.

## The Role of Government
Governments provide rules (property rights, contracts) and public goods (like roads or defense).

They also try to manage stability (inflation, unemployment) and distribution (taxes, welfare).




# Economy Types
## Command Economy (Planned Economy)

### How it works:
The government makes all major economic decisions. It controls what to produce, how to produce, and for whom.

### Key Features

#### Central Planning
A government agency (like a planning committee) decides:
	What goods and services are produced

	How resources (like labor and capital) are allocated

	What prices should be set

#### Public Ownership:
Most or all businesses and industries are owned by the state.

#### Limited Consumer Choice
Since production follows government plans—not consumer demand—there are fewer options for consumers.

#### Job Assignments
In extreme versions, the state may even assign people to specific jobs or careers.

### Goals
Eliminate inequality and promote economic equity

Prioritize national goals (e.g., defense, infrastructure)

Avoid unemployment by directing labor to where it's needed

### Common Problems

Inefficiency: Without profit signals or competition, there's less incentive to innovate or reduce waste

Shortages and Surpluses: Poor planning can mean too much of one thing (e.g., tractors) and not enough of another (e.g., food)

Bureaucracy: Central planning often creates massive bureaucracies, slowing down decisions

## Market Economy (Free Market or Capitalism)

How it works:
Decisions are made by individuals and businesses based on supply and demand. Prices are determined in competitive markets.
Key traits:

    Private property

    Profit motive

    Minimal government intervention

    Innovation and consumer choice
