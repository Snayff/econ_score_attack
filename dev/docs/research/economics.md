# Considerations for an Economy
## Scarcity and Choice
Scarcity means resources (like time, money, labor, and raw materials) are limited.

Because we can’t have everything, people and societies must make choices about how to use resources.

This leads to the concept of opportunity cost—the value of what you give up when you choose one thing over another.

## Supply and Demand
Prices are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers.

Demand: How much people want something at a given price.

Supply: How much producers are willing to offer at that price.

Where they meet is the market equilibrium, balancing quantity supplied and demanded.

## Incentives Matter
People and businesses respond to rewards and penalties.

Prices, profits, and taxes all influence behavior.

Good economic policy often works by shaping incentives, not forcing outcomes.

## Specialization and Trade
Individuals, regions, and countries focus on what they do best (comparative advantage), and trade for the rest.

This leads to greater efficiency, more output, and often lower prices.

## Markets Usually Work Well—But Not Always
Markets are powerful for organizing economic activity, but:
    They can fail (e.g., pollution, monopolies, or public goods)
    Government sometimes needs to step in to correct those failures

## Productivity Drives Standard of Living
The key to long-term economic growth is increasing productivity—producing more output per unit of input (especially per worker).

Education, technology, infrastructure, and innovation are major contributors.

## The Role of Government
Governments provide rules (property rights, contracts) and public goods (like roads or defense).

They also try to manage stability (inflation, unemployment) and distribution (taxes, welfare).




# Economy Types
## Command Economy (Planned Economy)

### How it works:
The government makes all major economic decisions. It controls what to produce, how to produce, and for whom.

### Key Features

#### Central Planning
A government agency (like a planning committee) decides:
	What goods and services are produced

	How resources (like labor and capital) are allocated

	What prices should be set

#### Public Ownership:
Most or all businesses and industries are owned by the state.

#### Limited Consumer Choice
Since production follows government plans—not consumer demand—there are fewer options for consumers.

#### Job Assignments
In extreme versions, the state may even assign people to specific jobs or careers.

### Goals
Eliminate inequality and promote economic equity

Prioritize national goals (e.g., defense, infrastructure)

Avoid unemployment by directing labor to where it's needed

### Common Problems

Inefficiency: Without profit signals or competition, there's less incentive to innovate or reduce waste

Shortages and Surpluses: Poor planning can mean too much of one thing (e.g., tractors) and not enough of another (e.g., food)

Bureaucracy: Central planning often creates massive bureaucracies, slowing down decisions

## Market Economy (Free Market or Capitalism)

How it works:
Decisions are made by individuals and businesses based on supply and demand. Prices are determined in competitive markets.
Key traits:

    Private property

    Profit motive

    Minimal government intervention

    Innovation and consumer choice


# Economic Metrics
## Standard of Living (Economic Focus)
This is usually quantified, focusing on material well-being:
### Key Measures
GDP per capita (most common)
	Total economic output divided by the population

	Often adjusted for cost of living using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

Household income or median income

Employment levels

Access to goods and services

Consumption per capita

Pros: Easy to compare across countries
Cons: Doesn’t capture inequality, well-being, or non-market factors

## Quality of Life (Broader Focus)

Includes non-economic factors that affect overall well-being:
Common Indicators:

    Human Development Index (HDI)

        Combines:

            Life expectancy

            Education level (years of schooling)

            Income (GNI per capita)

    OECD Better Life Index

        Includes housing, work-life balance, health, education, environment, safety, civic engagement, etc.

    World Happiness Report

        Based on self-reported well-being, social support, freedom, and corruption levels

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
### Expenditure Approach
GDP=C+I+G+(X−M)
GDP=C+I+G+(X−M)​

    C = Private consumption (household spending)

    I = Gross investment (business capital spending + residential construction + inventory changes)

    G = Government spending (on goods & services)

    X = Exports

    M = Imports

    Example: If households spend $8 trn, businesses invest $2 trn, government spends $3 trn, exports are $1 trn and imports $1.5 trn, then
    GDP = 8 + 2 + 3 + (1 – 1.5) = $12.5 trn.

### Income Approach
GDP=W+R+i+Π+(T−S)
GDP=W+R+i+Π+(T−S)​

    W = Wages & salaries

    R = Rents

    i = Interest

    Π = Profits

    T = Indirect taxes

    S = Subsidies

### Production (Value-Added) Approach

Sum of “value added” by each industry:
∑(Gross outputj−Intermediate inputsj)
∑(Gross outputj​−Intermediate inputsj​)

### Real vs. Nominal GDP

    Nominal GDP: Measured at current prices.

    Real GDP: Adjusted for price changes (inflation)—uses a base-year price level.

Real GDPt=Nominal GDPtGDP deflatort×100
Real GDPt​=GDP deflatort​Nominal GDPt​​×100​

## Economic Growth Rate
Growth rate=Real GDPt−Real GDPt−1Real GDPt−1×100%
Growth rate=Real GDPt−1​Real GDPt​−Real GDPt−1​​×100%​

## Inflation Rate

Most common: Consumer Price Index (CPI)
πt=CPIt−CPIt−1CPIt−1×100%
πt​=CPIt−1​CPIt​−CPIt−1​​×100%​

## Unemployment Rate
u=Number of unemployed peopleLabor force×100%
u=Labor forceNumber of unemployed people​×100%​

(Labor force = employed + unemployed.)

## Government Budget Balance
Budget balance=Tax revenue−Government spending
Budget balance=Tax revenue−Government spending​

    Deficit if negative; surplus if positive.

    Debt-to-GDP ratio:
    Government debtGDP×100%GDPGovernment debt​


##  Human Development Index (HDI)

A composite of:

    Life expectancy index

    Education index (mean + expected years of schooling)

    Income index (log GNI per capita)

HDI is the geometric mean of the three sub-indices.

## Productivity
Why it matters:

It’s the key driver of long-term growth and higher incomes.
Main metric:
Labor productivity=Output (GDP)Hours worked or number of workers
Labor productivity=Hours worked or number of workersOutput (GDP)​​

Also sometimes broken down into:

    Total Factor Productivity (TFP): Accounts for efficiency of all inputs (labor, capital, technology)

## OECD Better Life Index
Includes 11 dimensions, such as:

    Income and jobs

    Housing

    Education

    Environment

    Health

    Work-life balance

    Civic engagement

    Subjective well-being (life satisfaction)

    Interactive and allows countries to be ranked differently based on what individuals value most.

## World Happiness Report
Based on surveys of self-reported happiness, weighted by:

    GDP per capita

    Social support

    Healthy life expectancy

    Freedom to make life choices

    Generosity

    Corruption perception

    Often correlates with well-functioning institutions, trust, and social support—not just income.


## Inequality
###  Gini Coefficient
    Most widely used measure

    Ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality)

        A Gini of 0.3 is relatively equal; above 0.5 suggests high inequality.

Gini Index=Area between line of equality and Lorenz curveTotal area under line of equality
Gini Index=Total area under line of equalityArea between line of equality and Lorenz curve​​

    Often presented as a percentage: e.g., Gini of 0.4 = 40%.

### Lorenz Curve

    A graphical representation of income or wealth distribution.

    Shows the share of total income earned by each portion of the population (e.g., bottom 20%, top 10%).

### Income Shares

    Measures what share of national income goes to specific percentiles:

        Top 10% income share

        Bottom 40% share

        Top 1% or 0.1% share

    Helps highlight extreme concentration at the top.

### Palma Ratio

    Ratio of income share of the top 10% to that of the bottom 40%

        Palma = 1 means top 10% earn as much as bottom 40%.

        Higher values indicate more inequality.

### Wealth Inequality

    Wealth is often far more unequally distributed than income.

    Tracked through:

        Net worth quintiles

        Top 1% wealth share

        Surveys or tax records (e.g., Forbes lists, estate taxes)
