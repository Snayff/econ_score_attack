# Population System

## Overview
The population system manages the demesne's inhabitants, their skills, happiness, and behaviour. Population dynamics directly impact economic performance and game stability, with extreme unhappiness leading to game failure.

## Core Components

### Demographics
1. **Population Structure**
   - Age distribution
   - Skill levels
   - Employment status
   - Wealth distribution
   - Education levels

2. **Population Growth**
   - Birth rates
   - Death rates
   - Migration (internal only)
   - Population capacity limits

### Skills and Education
1. **Skill System**
   - Multiple skill categories
   - Skill level progression
   - Specialization options
   - Skill decay over time
   - Training and education effects

2. **Education System**
   - Education facilities
   - Training programs
   - Skill acquisition rates
   - Education costs
   - Teacher requirements

### Happiness and Unrest
1. **Happiness Factors**
   - Basic needs fulfillment
   - Luxury goods access
   - Employment status
   - Wage levels
   - Working conditions
   - Environmental quality
   - Social services access

2. **Unrest Mechanics**
   - Unrest accumulation
   - Protest triggers
   - Strike actions
   - Civil disobedience
   - Revolutionary potential
   - Game over threshold

### Population Behaviour
1. **Economic Decisions**
   - Job selection
   - Consumption patterns
   - Savings behaviour
   - Investment choices
   - Business creation

2. **Social Behaviour**
   - Community formation
   - Social mobility
   - Political engagement
   - Environmental awareness
   - Cultural development

## Population Indicators
- Overall happiness index
- Unrest level
- Skill distribution
- Employment rate
- Education level
- Health status
- Wealth inequality
- Social mobility rate

## Player Tools
1. **Population Management**
   - Education funding
   - Social programs
   - Healthcare provision
   - Housing development
   - Working condition regulations

2. **Unrest Management**
   - Social policies
   - Public relations
   - Emergency measures
   - Protest response options
   - Concession negotiations

3. **Skill Development**
   - Training programs
   - Educational institutions
   - Specialization incentives
   - Technology adoption support

## System Interactions

## Critical States
1. **Social Crisis**

   - Education system failure
   - Housing crisis

2. **Revolutionary Conditions**
   - Critical unrest levels
   - Mass protests
   - General strikes
   - Civil disobedience
   - System breakdown

## Implementation Notes
- Population simulation granularity
- Performance optimization for large populations
- Behaviour model complexity
- Event system integration
- Statistical tracking requirements
