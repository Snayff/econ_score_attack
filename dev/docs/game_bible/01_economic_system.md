# Economic System

## Overview
The economic system forms the core of gameplay, implementing a closed-loop economy where all resources and goods must be produced within the demesne. No external resources can enter the system, creating a carefully balanced economic ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Currency System
- **Base Currency**: Demesne-specific currency used for all transactions
- **Monetary Policy**:
  - Interest rate controls
  - Money supply management
  - Inflation/deflation mechanics
  - Currency stability indicators

### Market Mechanics
1. **Supply and Demand**
   - Dynamic pricing based on availability and need
   - Price elasticity varies by good type
   - Market equilibrium calculations
   - Supply/demand graphs available to player

2. **Market Manipulation**
   - Price controls (minimum/maximum prices)
   - Strategic resource hoarding
   - Market cornering mechanics
   - Trade regulation options
   - Consequences of market manipulation:
     - Black markets
     - Smuggling
     - Social unrest

3. **Banking System**
   - Loans and interest rates
   - Business investment options
   - Savings accounts for population
   - Bank stability mechanics
   - Risk of bank runs

### Trade System
1. **Internal Trade**
   - Between different sectors of the demesne
   - Transport costs and logistics
   - Trade route optimization
   - Market access limitations

2. **Supply Chain**
   - Resource flow tracking
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Disruption risks:
     - Natural disasters
     - Social unrest
     - Infrastructure failure
     - Resource depletion

## Economic Indicators
- GDP tracking
- Employment rates
- Wage levels
- Price indices
- Production output
- Consumer confidence
- Market stability index

## Player Tools

## Failure States
1. **Economic Collapse**
   - Hyperinflation
   - Banking system failure
   - Market crash
   - Trade network breakdown

2. **Social Consequences**
   - Population unrest from economic hardship
   - Migration due to poor conditions
   - Business failures and unemployment
   - Loss of essential services

## Generated Ideas

### Banking System Mechanics
1. **Bank Creation and Management**
   - Players can establish multiple banks with different specializations
   - Banks require physical buildings and staff
   - Each bank can set its own interest rates and lending policies
   - Banks compete for population deposits
   - Bank reputation system affects deposit attraction

2. **Lending Mechanics**
   - Different loan types (business, personal, construction)
   - Collateral requirements based on loan size
   - Credit rating system for population and businesses
   - Loan default mechanics with property seizure
   - Debt restructuring options

3. **Market Manipulation Examples**
   - Create artificial shortages by buying up essential goods
   - Establish monopolies in key industries
   - Use insider knowledge from government position
   - Manipulate currency value through policy
   - Control resource access points

4. **Black Market Dynamics**
   - Emerges automatically when price controls are too restrictive
   - Operates in physical locations that must be discovered
   - Can be raided by authorities (player choice)
   - Provides alternative revenue streams
   - Increases unrest if too prevalent

5. **Currency Management Mini-game**
   - Visual interface for money supply control
   - Real-time inflation/deflation effects
   - Currency stability indicators
   - Foreign exchange mechanics (within demesne regions)
   - Emergency currency controls

6. **Trade Route Strategy**
   - Physical route planning on the map
   - Transport cost optimization
   - Route security considerations
   - Weather and seasonal effects
   - Infrastructure requirements
