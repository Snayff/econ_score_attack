# Economic System

## Overview
The economic system forms the core of gameplay, implementing a closed-loop economy where all resources and goods must be produced within the demesne. No external resources can enter the system, creating a carefully balanced economic ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Currency System
- **Base Currency**: Demesne-specific currency used for all transactions
- **Monetary Policy**:
  - Interest rate controls
  - Money supply management
  - Inflation/deflation mechanics
  - Currency stability indicators

### Market Mechanics
1. **Supply and Demand**
   - Dynamic pricing based on availability and need
   - Price elasticity varies by good type
   - Market equilibrium calculations
   - Supply/demand graphs available to player

2. **Market Manipulation**
   - Price controls (minimum/maximum prices)
   - Strategic resource hoarding
   - Market cornering mechanics
   - Trade regulation options
   - Consequences of market manipulation:
     - Black markets
     - Smuggling
     - Social unrest

3. **Banking System**
   - Loans and interest rates
   - Business investment options
   - Savings accounts for population
   - Bank stability mechanics
   - Risk of bank runs

### Trade System
1. **Internal Trade**
   - Between different sectors of the demesne
   - Transport costs and logistics
   - Trade route optimization
   - Market access limitations

2. **Supply Chain**
   - Resource flow tracking
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Disruption risks:
     - Natural disasters
     - Social unrest
     - Infrastructure failure
     - Resource depletion

## Economic Indicators
- GDP tracking
- Employment rates
- Wage levels
- Price indices
- Production output
- Consumer confidence
- Market stability index

## Player Tools
1. **Market Analysis**
   - Price history
   - Supply/demand charts
   - Economic forecasting
   - Risk assessment tools

2. **Policy Controls**
   - Interest rate adjustment
   - Price control implementation
   - Trade regulation
   - Banking policy
   - Currency management

3. **Wealth Extraction Methods**
   - Direct taxation
   - Market manipulation profits
   - State enterprise ownership
   - Banking system profits
   - Resource rights licensing

## System Interactions

### With Population System
- Wages affect happiness
- Employment levels impact stability
- Consumer purchasing power
- Skill levels affect productivity
- Population wealth distribution

### With Production System
- Resource availability affects prices
- Production efficiency impacts supply
- Technology level influences output
- Infrastructure affects trade costs

### With Governance System
- Economic policies and laws
- Corruption impacts efficiency
- Regulation enforcement costs
- Tax collection effectiveness

### With Environmental System
- Resource depletion effects
- Natural disaster impacts
- Seasonal production variations
- Environmental damage costs

### With Technology System
- Production efficiency improvements
- New resource utilization methods
- Banking system modernization
- Market analysis tools

## Failure States
1. **Economic Collapse**
   - Hyperinflation
   - Banking system failure
   - Market crash
   - Trade network breakdown

2. **Social Consequences**
   - Population unrest from economic hardship
   - Migration due to poor conditions
   - Business failures and unemployment
   - Loss of essential services

## Implementation Notes
- All economic calculations must maintain system closure
- Regular economic state validation checks
- Performance optimization for large-scale simulations
- Clear feedback mechanisms for player decisions
