# Economic Score Attack - Game Bible

## Game Concept
A strategy simulation game where players manage a demesne's economy with the goal of extracting maximum personal wealth. The game focuses on economic management, resource allocation, and balancing various competing interests while maintaining social stability.

## Core Design Pillars
1. **Economic Realism**: A closed-loop economy where all resources and goods must be produced within the system
2. **Dynamic Systems**: Interconnected systems that react to player decisions and each other
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision has both immediate and long-term consequences
4. **Balanced Risk**: Higher rewards come with increased risk of social unrest
5. **Emergent Gameplay**: Systems interact to create unique situations and challenges

## Game Systems Overview
The game consists of several interconnected systems, each detailed in their own document:

1. [Economic System](01_economic_system.md)
   - Currency and Markets
   - Banking and Lending
   - Price Controls and Market Manipulation

2. [Population System](02_population_system.md)
   - Demographics and Skills
   - Happiness and Unrest
   - Education and Development

3. [Production System](03_production_system.md)
   - Resource Management
   - Supply Chains
   - Efficiency and Modernisation

4. [Governance System](04_governance_system.md)
   - Laws and Policies
   - Corruption
   - Direct Intervention

5. [Environmental System](05_environmental_system.md)
   - Resource Depletion
   - Natural Events
   - Seasonal Effects

6. [Technology System](06_technology_system.md)
   - Research and Development
   - Innovation Effects
   - Modernisation

## Core Game Loop
1. Player manages resources and makes economic decisions
2. Population reacts to conditions and makes autonomous decisions
3. Market prices adjust based on supply and demand
4. Environmental and social conditions evolve
5. Player extracts wealth while managing consequences

## Victory and Failure
- **Victory**: Measured by total personal wealth extracted
- **Failure**: Triggered by critical population unrest levels

## Key Interactions Between Systems
- Economic decisions impact population happiness
- Technology advances affect production efficiency
- Environmental conditions influence resource availability
- Population skills affect production output
- Market conditions influence population behaviour
- Governance choices affect all other systems
