# Economic Score Attack - Game Bible

## Game Concept
A strategy simulation game where players manage a demesne's economy with the goal of extracting maximum personal wealth. The game focuses on economic management, resource allocation, and balancing various competing interests while maintaining social stability. As there can be no violence against conscious beings, the player must find other means to exceed those around them. 

## Intro
You exit the rift, blinking in the dim light of a new world, the sound of your former home's destruction ringing in your ears. As you regain your senses, and begin to survey what few of your people made it through with you, your hear Au's voice within you. Not hear, not really. More *feel*. Deep, in what might be considered your soul. 

"There will be no more worlds, no more escapes. This is it. They will return soon enough to finish what has begun. It is time to focus on Paradise. Come join me, here, my children. Shower in my glory and buy your way into my kingdom. So that you might fully show me your worship, I will bestow upon you my auspices - there will be no violence against the peoples of this world, no devotions cut short as a result of ambition to join me. Further, those that you deign to rule you will be removed from entropy's gaze. Now, go forth. I shall see you as the century turns, for one last time. "


## Core Design Pillars
1. **Economic Realism**: A closed-loop economy where all resources and goods must be produced within the system
2. **Dynamic Systems**: Interconnected systems that react to player decisions and each other
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision has both immediate and long-term consequences
4. **Balanced Risk**: Higher rewards come with increased risk of social unrest
5. **Emergent Gameplay**: Systems interact to create unique situations and challenges

## Game Systems Overview
The game consists of several interconnected systems, each detailed in their own document:

1. [Economic System](01_economic_system.md)
   - Currency and Markets
   - Banking and Lending
   - Price Controls and Market Manipulation

2. [Population System](02_population_system.md)
   - Demographics and Skills
   - Happiness and Unrest
   - Education and Development

3. [Production System](03_production_system.md)
   - Resource Management
   - Supply Chains
   - Efficiency and Modernisation

4. [Governance System](04_governance_system.md)
   - Laws and Policies
   - Corruption
   - Direct Intervention

5. [Environmental System](05_environmental_system.md)
   - Resource Depletion
   - Natural Events
   - Seasonal Effects

6. [Technology System](06_technology_system.md)
   - Research and Development
   - Innovation Effects
   - Modernisation

## Core Game Loop
1. Player manages resources and makes economic decisions
2. Population reacts to conditions and makes autonomous decisions
3. Market prices adjust based on supply and demand
4. Environmental and social conditions evolve
5. Player extracts wealth while managing consequences

## Victory and Failure
- **Victory**: Measured by total personal wealth extracted by time removed from rule, or at the end of year 100. 
- **Failure**: Triggered by critical population unrest levels

## Key Interactions Between Systems
- Economic decisions impact population happiness
- Technology advances affect production efficiency
- Environmental conditions influence resource availability
- Population skills affect production output
- Market conditions influence population behaviour
- Governance choices affect all other systems
