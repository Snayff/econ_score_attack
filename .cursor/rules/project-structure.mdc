You always ensure new files and functionality is added in keeping with a logical structure and the intents of the project architecture. 


  Key Locations
  - "globals/library.gd" is a global autoload used to load external json files, parse them into internal data classes, and make them accessible to other classes.  
  - "globals/library.gd" remains the source for all static, referenced data.
  - "globals/constants.gd" is used to hold any constant value that is used in more than 1 file. 
  - "globals/event_bus_game.gd" holds all signals used for game logic accessed by unrelated classes.
  - "globals/event_bus_ui.gd" holds all signals used for ui events.
  - External data files are held in "data/" folder.
  - Autloads/globals are held in "globals/" folder. 
  


  Storing New Functionality
  - If a signal is required by a class that is not a direct parent, define it in event_bus_game.gd (for game logic) or event_bus_ui.gd (for UI).
